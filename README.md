# Trojan Bill Regulation Proposal (Captatori Informatici)
Collection of Artifacts related to the Bill proposal to regulate the uses by LEA of Trojans in Italy in 2017.

The Bill Proposal project has been made by a core team of 4 with a high numbers of volounteers and reviewers over around 2 years time. It didn't become a reality because the Italian Government collapsed before the Law was scheduled to be discussed by the Parliament.

The team that worked on the the bill proposal was composed as follow:
* [Stefano Quintarelli](https://twitter.com/quinta), MP experts in IT and Cybersecurity
* [Stefano Aterno](https://twitter.com/AternoStefano), Criminal Lawyers experts in Hacking Cases
* [Fabio Pietrosanti](https://twitter.com/fpietrosanti), Security and Digital Rights Expert
* [Andrea Ghirardini](https://twitter.com/darkpila), Security and Computer Forensic Expert

This repository is made up for valuable juridical, human rights, forensics and technical interests on the topic internationally.

   * 1. The source code must be stored and verifiable.
   * 2. Every action must be documented completely, tamper-proof and verifiable.
   * 3. The malware must not weaken the general security level of the device
   * 4. The development and use of malware must be carried out by means of a central recording be understandable. 
   * 5. Independent certification of technical and data protection requirements be renewed regularly.
   * 6. Encryption and integrity protection of the data collected. 
   * 7. Limitation of sovereign tasks to government agencies.

 * "We strongly support the provisions in Civici e Innovatori’s proposal intended to ensure integrity, authenticity, and immutability of data and devices impacted by government hacking"
 * "There are several other provisions in the proposal that we believe will help protect human rights. First, we are in favor of the provision that prohibits the use of contractors to employ hacking tools"
 * "We are appreciative of Civici e Innovatori’s engagement on this important issue and incorporation of several human rights protections into the draft proposal."
