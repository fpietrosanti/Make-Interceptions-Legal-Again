* [Access Now](https://www.accessnow.org/) on 29 March 2017 publish a [Policy Review of the Bill Proposal](https://github.com/fpietrosanti/trojanregulations/blob/master/Access-Now-Comment-on-the-Trojan-Bill-Proposal.pdf) specifying among many considerations that:
  * "While Access Now does not condone government hacking activity [...] we believe it is of pivotal importance that if it is to be conducted, it is done within a robust legal framework."
* "We appreciate the provision within the proposal that seeks to establish strict use limitations for these authorities."
* "We strongly support the provisions in Civici e Innovatori’s proposal intended to ensure integrity, authenticity, and immutability of data and devices impacted by government hacking"
* "There are several other provisions in the proposal that we believe will help protect human rights. First, we are in favor of the provision that prohibits the use of contractors to employ hacking tools"
* "We are appreciative of Civici e Innovatori’s engagement on this important issue and incorporation of several human rights protections into the draft proposal."
